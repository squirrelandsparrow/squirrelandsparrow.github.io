What better way for a new blog to get your attention than with food! Everybody loves a grilled cheese sandwich – it's the ultimate comfort food. This is a stepped-up but still easy version of the classic.

I'll spare you the chit chat and get right to it.

#### step 1: slice bread...
![slicing delicious bread][slice-bread]

Here, I'm using cheese bread from the local French bakery. That's right, cheese bread. There's cheese... *IN THE BREAD!* My head is exploding just a little bit...

You can use whatever bread you like, but this isn't the rookie version we're making here – pick something good.

#### step 2: butter outside of bread...

Symmetry is important for a truly harmonious sandwich – be sure you butter the opposite (outer) sides of the bread. I'm using a spreadable butter blend, so as not to tear up the bread. If you use whole butter, let it sit out and soften a bit first. You could also use olive oil, coconut oil or even margarine. You'll get no judgement from me.

#### step 3: mayo inside of bread...

Turn the bread butter-side down and spread mayo on the inside. I'm working on parchment paper. If you don't, you'll eventually discover why I do.

#### step 4: slice tomato...

Slice a tomato thin or thick, however you like. Thicker will make for a messier sandwich, but nobody's taking off points for that. Use a nice, ripe, tasty tomato. The little ones on the vine are usually good. Those brown kumato things are amazing.

Since you're using such a delicious tomato, go ahead and slice up the whole thing. Trust me.

#### step 5: slice cheese...

![creamy sliced cheese][slice-cheese]

Slice a good amount of cheese – better too much than not enough. Any soft, creamy cheese that melts well will work. Havarti, Emmantaler, Gouda or Raclette are all good choices, as are many more. Avoid cheeses with a lot of moisture, like Mozzarella. Though tasty, hard cheeses like aged Cheddar or Gruyere won't melt well, if at all, in the short time that your sandwich will be cooking. 

#### step 6: assemble as you please...

Arrange your cheese, tomato and optional garnishes onto the bread, as much as will fit. This is your chance to make the sandwich your own. I like to add fresh salad greens or spinach and a little pickle relish (a childhood throwback, that one – might not be for everyone). A generous sprinkle of sea salt is a must where tomato is involved.

#### step 7: coat with parmesan...

This is a new suggestion I came across recently. I haven't tried it, but I'm intrigued. I know, I know... it's already cheese bread – there's a lot of cheese baked *INTO THE BREAD!* Do we really need more cheese all over the outside, too??

Silly question. Of course we do.

Sprinkle parmesan onto the paper or directly onto the sandwich, and press into the buttered bread.

#### step 8: make it sizzle...

Now the magic happens. Slide the sandwich into your skillet of opportunity and wait. Low and slow is best for a composition of this magnitude. You want the bread to brown slowly while the insides warm gently.

If you have any leftover tomato slices, now is the time to eat them. Don't forget the sea salt.

#### step 9: flip it...

Like your favorite vinyl LP, turn that thing over and dig that tasty skillet music. Check yourself for drooling.

#### step 10: serve it...

As with any good grilled cheese, I've paired mine with a bowl of soup and a pickle spear. Tomato soup is a classic, but hey, it's the sandwich that's the star of this show. Now, go eat it!

I feel like the grilled cheese is best when it's made of the moment, on a whim, with no set ingredients, just whatever you fancy or whatever you have. That said, some things work better than others, and if you want to make it just like this one, here's what you'll need.

* French bread (cheese loaf)
* butter/olive oil blend
* mayonnaise
* vine-ripe tomato
* Havarti cheese
* spinach
* sweet relish
* sea salt
* grated parmesan cheese
